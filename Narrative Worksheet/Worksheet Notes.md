## Changes being made 10/11/2022

I am currently working to incorporate the Base Calculator feature into the plan narrative worksheet
This will be hidden as a button, then reveal Plan Payments, Additional payments, and Forgive Amounts. 
The additional payments and forgive amounts will be hidden by default
After entering the calculatable amounts, the generate note button will be used to populate the text box TextBox_186_10301 with the forum type note

# Narrative Worksheet 

**This is the worksheet that I am most proud of accomplishing**

I created this worksheet following our local Chapter 13 Plan form provided by the court. Our staff review the plan and enter the information into this worksheet. This worksheet will then create automated forum notes for the data from the plan in an easy to read format. 
For amended plans, if this worksheet was used previously, it will perform a comparison between the old and the new format and in the forum note, it will highlight the differences automatically.
